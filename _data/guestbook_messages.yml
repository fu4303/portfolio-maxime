  body: "Interesting post on how to dumb down the &#39;smart&#39;phone. \r\n\r\nI
    have started to take screenshots of my mobile usage as the screen time data on
    my iPhone doesn&#39;t allow a download of aggregated data! \r\n\r\nCompletely
    agree on how shocking it is to realise how many app&#39;s poke themselves into
    our attention everyday. "

  body: So stoked to try out your digital garden template! Couldn&#39;t find a blogging
    platform that was going to fit what I was looking for, was a little trepidatious
    about jekyll from scratch, and yours looks super slick! Very happy I found ya

    EVO 250GB 2.5&quot; SATA SSD, a Broadcom 4253 Wifi AC 867Mbps + Bluetooth, and
    recently upgraded thermal paste.  The display panel, bezel, palm wrest, and trackpad
    have all seen better days, but, this thing is a veritable workhorse that won&#39;t
    die!  I have the ultrabase with the key, the external battery charger, and every
    battery aside from the 2-cell but I don&#39;t seem to be missing much there.\r\n\r\nReading
    your blog made me feel happy.  It&#39;s always nice to see other people doing
    the same sorts of things out there!"

  body: Hello, thank you very much for the content, Maxime! Your digital garden template
    was just the one I have been looking for a long time, in Jekyll and having both
    support for wikilinks with spaces in them as well as graph visualization. I just
    really wanted to get that appreciation across to you. Thanks again!
